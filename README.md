# IPython3 Notebooks #
Just a bunch of iPython notebooks for future references.

# List of notebooks #
### [Matrix Decomposition](./eigen_vs_svd.ipynb): Eigenvalue decomposition vs SVD ###
### [ICP](./icp.ipynb): SVD vs Least Squares ###
### [Non-Linear Least Squares](./least_squares.ipynb) ###
We start with a typical least squares formulation and go through most useful
methods for solving this type of minimization problems, such as *Steepest
Gradient Descent* and the *Gauss-Newton method*. We derive everything from the
way the problem looks like and use its Taylor expansion.
